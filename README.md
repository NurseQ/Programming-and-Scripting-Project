# Programming-and-Scripting-Project
This repository contains analysis of [Fisher's Iris flower data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). It includes research of the dataset, analysis, documentation and code written in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. The full documentation of the project in the repository can be found in [PROJECT.md](https://github.com/NurseQ/Project-Iris-Flower-Dataset/blob/master/PROJECT.md). This is a project for the course Programming and Scripting, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Higher Diploma in Data Analytics. This course is offered by [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie/) and taught by Dr. Ian McLoughlin.

## Fisher's Iris Flower Dataset
[Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) introduced the Iris flower dataset in 1936 and it is considered to be the best known database for pattern recognition [1]. The data set consists of measurements from three species of the Iris flower. Fifty samples from each are measured, taking the length and width of the flowers' sepals and petals.

## Investigations into dataset
The project first introduces Fisher's data set and provides background information regarding the data set. Investigations of the data set, using the Python programming language follows. The investigation section is laid out to start from opening the data set into more complex manipulation of the data. The investigation section explains how the data is split and, using other Python libraries, graphical representations and statistical analysis of the data are presented. Snippets or extracts of code are provided for clarity and detail of the investigations. General observations and analysis of the graphs are presented after the investigation section. The The full documentation of the project  can be found in the repository as [PROJECT.md](https://github.com/NurseQ/Project-Iris-Flower-Dataset/blob/master/PROJECT.md).   

## Python Code
All of the code in this repository are written in the Python programming language. The codes can be copied, downloaded and run locally in your machine if you have the appropriate software. [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) are the recommended software packages to run the code, both are free and open source. The project document, [PROJECT.md], (https://github.com/NurseQ/Project-Iris-Flower-Dataset/blob/master/PROJECT.md) provides more details with regard to the details of the codes.
