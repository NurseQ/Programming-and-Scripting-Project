# Programming-and-Scripting-Project
This repository contains analysis of [Fisher's Iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). It includes research of the dataset, analysis, documentation and code written in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. The full documentation of the project in the repository can be found in [PROJECT.md](https://github.com/NurseQ/Project-Iris-Flower-Dataset/blob/master/PROJECT.md). This is a project for the course Programming and Scripting, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Higher Diploma in Data Analytics. This course is offered by [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie/) and taught by Dr. Ian McLoughlin.

# Fisher's Iris Flower Dataset
Ronald Fisher introduced the Iris Flower dataset in 1936.  It is considered to be the best known database for pattern recognition (1). Using a statistical method of discriminant analysis(2) to find a linear combination of features that characterize or separates two or more classes or events(3).

# Investigations into dataset
The project first introduces Fishers data set and provides background information regarding the data set. Investigations of the dataset, using the Python programming language follows. The investigation section is laid out to start from opening the data set into more complex manipulation of the data. Snippets or extracts of code are provided for clarity and detail for the investigations. The full documentation of the project in the repository can be found in [PROJECT.md](https://github.com/NurseQ/Project-Iris-Flower-Dataset/blob/master/PROJECT.md).   

# Clearly Document how to run the Python code and what the code does
All of the code in this repository are written in the Python programming language. They can be downloaded and run locally in your machine if you have the appropriate software. VS code and Anaconda are the recommended software packages to run the code. Both are free and open source. The Anaconda software package contains most of the common libraries needed for data science and machine learning related applications.
