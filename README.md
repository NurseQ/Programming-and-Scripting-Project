# Programming-and-Scripting-Project
This repository contains analysis of Fisher's Iris dataset. It includes research of the dataset, analysis, documentation and code written in the Python programming language. This is a project for the course Programming and Scripting, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Higher Diploma in Data Analytics. 

# Fisher's Iris Flower Dataset
Ronald Fisher introduced the Iris Flower dataset in 1936.  It is considered to be the best known database for pattern recognition (1). Using a statistical method of discriminant analysis(2) to find a linear combination of features that characterize or separates two or more classes or events(3).

# Investigations into dataset
Investigation into the dataset are described in detail in the repository under PROJECT.md. Please click here to read the project.

# Clearly Document how to run the Python code and what the code does
All of the code are written in the Python programming language. They can be downloaded and run locally in your machine if you have the appropriate software. VS code and Anaconda are the recommended software packages to run the code. Both are free and open source. The Anaconda software package contains most of the common libraries needed for data science and machine learning related applications.
